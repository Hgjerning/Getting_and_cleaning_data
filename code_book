One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing.
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The attached R script, run_analysis.R, performs the requested tasks:

0. Downloading train & test data: creates a Project directory, downloads the requested zip file and unzip the file

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. The script reads the data and merges the data tables
pair-wise for training and test data 

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. Each of the three main tables
(features, subject and activity) are given names and the three datasets are merged to one dataset
called sensorData.

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. Spacing is removed and names are all
put to lowercase. Finally are name appreviations replaced by more meaningfull names.

5. From the data set in step 4, averages are calculated for subject and activity and a new
clean data set is generated using write.table. The new dataset is called tidySensorData.
